Subject: RFQ Request: opc-go-001 and opc-go-002 crop transformation studies

Body:

Hello Todd,

We are requesting quotes for two crop engineering studies:
- RFQ `rfq-opc-go-001-v1`: editing transformation-competence determinants in recalcitrant bioenergy crop genotypes.
- RFQ `rfq-opc-go-002-v1`: safe-harbor/insulator validation for stable transgene expression.

Please see attached scope, deliverables, acceptance criteria, and redline clarifications.

Requested response format:
1. Milestone-based pricing and assumptions.
2. Expected attrition and independent-event yield per arm.
3. Timeline to first analyzable dataset.
4. Any exclusions, clarifications, or permitting constraints.

Dates:
- Questions due: 2026-02-18
- Quotes due: 2026-02-25
