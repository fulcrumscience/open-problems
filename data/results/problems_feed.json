To demonstrate causality, the authors should implement approaches to specifically disrupt the MDH1-CIT1 interaction. One strategy could involve using a 15-residue peptide (Pept1) derived from the Pro354-Pro366 region of CIT1, previously shown to mediate the interaction, or introducing the cit1\u03943 (Arg362Glu) mutation, which perturbs binding.

This inhibitor seems selective; however, it has been reported that it exhibits different efficiency in inhibiting the individual WNK kinases among each other (e.g. PMID: 31017050, PMID: 36712947). Additionally, the authors do not analyze nor report the expression profiles or activity levels of WNK1, WNK2, WNK3, and WNK4 within the relevant brain regions (i.e. hippocampus, cortex, amygdala). Combined, these weaknesses raise concerns about the direct involvement of WNK kinases within the selected brain regions and behavior circuits. It would be beneficial if the authors provided gene profiling for WNK1, 2, 3, and -4 (e.g. using Allen brain atlas). To confirm the observations, the authors should either add results from using other WNK inhibitors or, preferentially, analyze knock-down or knock-out animals/tissue targeting the single kinases.",

        "original_text": "(7) In the in vitro studies of senescence markers, it is not convincingly shown that the cells are actually senescent. Even though there changes found in expression of p16 and SA-Bgal in the cultures, the authors did not evaluate key senescence phenotypes such as the actual cell cycle arrest, SASP proteins or apoptosis resistance. Are the cells actually senescent or are these markers simply increasing? Hence much of the changes driven by TET2 overexpression in the in vitro cell lines could likely changes in p16 protein but not actually a senescence phenotype. BTC6, INS1E, and MIN6 are cell lines that are transformed, and while they can undergo some senescence-like changes in response to specific stressors like lipotoxicity, DNA damage, or oxidative stress, the authors did not evaluate these, only senescence genes/proteins in otherwise unstressed cells. Thus the claim that TET2 modifies senescence of beta cells remains unsubstantiated from the in vitro studies.",

Additionally, this paper showed that depletion of maternal KDM1A protein results in developmental arrest at the two-cell stage... All embryos in the TCP group were arrested at the four-cell stage. Embryos generated from KDM1b KO females can survive until E10.5 (Ciccone et al., 2009); therefore, TCP-treated embryos show a more severe phenotype than oocyte-derived KDM1b deleted embryos... The authors need to examine whether TCP treatment affects KDM1a expression.",
